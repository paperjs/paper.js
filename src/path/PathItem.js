    /**
     * Smooths the path item without changing the amount of segments in the path
     * or moving the segments' locations, by smoothing and adjusting the angle
     * and length of the segments' handles based on the position and distance of
     * neighboring segments.
     *
     * Smoothing works both for open paths and closed paths, and can be applied
     * to the full path, as well as a sub-range of it. If a range is defined
     * using the `options.from` and `options.to` properties, only the curve
     * handles inside that range are touched. If one or both limits of the range
     * are specified in negative indices, the indices are wrapped around the end
     * of the curve. That way, a smoothing range in a close path can even wrap
     * around the connection between the last and the first segment.
     *
     * Four different smoothing methods are available:
     *
     * - `'continuous'` smooths the path item by adjusting its curve handles so
     *     that the first and second derivatives of all involved curves are
     *     continuous across their boundaries.
     *
     *     This method tends to result in the smoothest results, but does not
     *     allow for further parametrization of the handles.
     *
     * - `'asymmetric'` is based on the same principle as `'continuous'` but
     *     uses different factors so that the result is asymmetric. This used to
     *     the only method available until v0.10.0, and is currently still the
     *     default when no method is specified, for reasons of backward
     *     compatibility. It will eventually be removed.
     *
     * - `'catmull-rom'` uses the Catmull-Rom spline to smooth the segment.
     *
     *     The optionally passed factor controls the knot parametrization of the
     *     algorithm:
     *
     *     - `0.0`: the standard, uniform Catmull-Rom spline
     *     - `0.5`: the centripetal Catmull-Rom spline, guaranteeing no
     *         self-intersections
     *     - `1.0`: the chordal Catmull-Rom spline
     *
     * - `'geometric'` use a simple heuristic and empiric geometric method to
     *     smooth the segment's handles. The handles were weighted, meaning that
     *     big differences in distances between the segments will lead to
     *     probably undesired results.
     *
     *     The optionally passed factor defines the tension parameter (`0...1`),
     *     controlling the amount of smoothing as a factor by which to scale
     *     each handle.
