         * neighboring segments.
         * 
         * Smoothing works both for open paths and closed paths, and can be applied
         * to the full path, as well as a sub-range of it. If a range is defined

         * of the curve. That way, a smoothing range in a close path can even wrap
         * around the connection between the last and the first segment.
         * 
         * Four different smoothing methods are available:
         *

         *     continuous across their boundaries.
         * 
         *     This method tends to result in the smoothest results, but does not
         *     allow for further parametrization of the handles.
         * 
         * - `'asymmetric'` is based on the same principle as `'continuous'` but
         *     uses different factors so that the result is asymmetric. This used to
         *     the only method available until v0.10.0, and is currently still the
         *     default when no method is specified, for reasons of backward
         *     compatibility. It will eventually be removed.
         * 
         * - `'catmull-rom'` uses the Catmull-Rom spline to smooth the segment.
         * 
         *     The optionally passed factor controls the knot parametrization of the
         *     algorithm:
         * 
         *     - `0.0`: the standard, uniform Catmull-Rom spline
         *     - `0.5`: the centripetal Catmull-Rom spline, guaranteeing no
         *         self-intersections
         *     - `1.0`: the chordal Catmull-Rom spline
         * 
         * - `'geometric'` use a simple heuristic and empiric geometric method to
         *     smooth the segment's handles. The handles were weighted, meaning that
         *     big differences in distances between the segments will lead to
         *     probably undesired results.
         * 
         *     The optionally passed factor defines the tension parameter (`0...1`),
         *     controlling the amount of smoothing as a factor by which to scale
         *     each handle.
