# Paper.js - The Swiss Army Knife of Vector Graphics Scripting

If you want to work with Paper.js, simply download the latest "stable" version from [http://paperjs.org/download/](http://paperjs.org/download/)

- Website: <http://paperjs.org/>
- Discussion forum: <http://groups.google.com/group/paperjs>
- Mainline source code: <https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js>
- Twitter: [@paperjs](http://twitter.com/paperjs)
- Daily development builds: <http://paperjs.org/downloads/>

## Development

**Get the source (for building):**

Git 1.6.5 and later:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/paperjs/paper.js.git

Git 1.6.4 and earlier:

	git clone git://github.com/paperjs/paper.js.git
	cd paper.js
	git submodule update --init

**Get the source (for contributing):**

If you want to contribute to the project you will have to [make a fork](http://help.github.com/forking/). Then do this:

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:yourusername/paper.js.git
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/paperjs/paper.js.git

### Refreshing Your Clone

To fetch changes from origin, run

	git fetch origin

If you are working with a fork and would like to fetch from upstream, run

	git fetch upstream

To update the `jsdoc-toolkit` submodule inside the `build` folder, used to generate the documentation, run

	git submodule update --init

### Building the Library

The Paper.js sources are distributed across many separate files, organised in subfolders inside the `src` folder. To compile them all into one distributable file, yo need to run the `build.sh` script inside the `build` folder:

	cd build
	./build.sh

You will then find the built library inside the `dist` folder, named `paper.js`.

`build.sh` offer a row of modes:

	commented		Preprocessed but still formated and commented
	stripped		Formated but without comments (default)
	compressed		Uses UglifyJS to reduce file size

In order to build a compressed version of Paper.js, UglifyJS2 needs to be installed:

    npm install uglify-js

### Building the Documentation

Similarly to building the library, you can run `docs.sh` inside the `build` folder to build the documentation.

	cd build
	./docs.sh

Your docs will then be located at `dist/docs`.

### Editing and Running Code during Development

As a handy alternative to building the library after each change to try it out in your scripts, there is a helper script `src/load.js` that loads the library directly from all the separate source files in the `src` folder. The shell script `load.sh` in the `build` folder produces a `paper.js` library in `dist` that does nothing else than loading the source files through `src/load.js`. This means you can switch between loading from sources and loading a built library simply by running `build.sh` or `load.sh` inside the `build` folder.

	cd build
	./load.sh

And to go back to a built library

	cd build
	./build.sh

Note that your PaperScripts examples do not need to change, they can simply load `dist/paper.js`, which will always do the right rhing.

### Testing

Paper.js was developed and tested from day 1 using proper unit testing through jQuery's [Qunit](http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit). To run the tests after any change to the library's source, simply open `index.html` inside the `test` folder in your web browser. There should be a green bar at the top, meaning all tests have passed. If the bar is red, some tests have not passed. These will be highlighted and become visible when scrolling down.

### Contributing

The main Paper.js source tree is hosted on git (a popular [DVCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control)), thus you should create a fork of the repository in which you perform development. See <http://help.github.com/forking/>.

We prefer that you send a [*pull request* here on GitHub](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) which will then be merged into the official main line repository. You need to sign the Paper.js CLA to be able to contribute (see below).

Also, in your first contribution, add yourself to the end of `AUTHORS.md` (which of course is optional).

#### Creating and Submitting a Patch

As mentioned earlier in this article, we prefer that you send a [*pull request*](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) on GitHub.

1. Create a fork of the upstream repository by visiting <https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/fork>. If you feel insecure, here's a great guide: <http://help.github.com/forking/>

2. Clone of your repository: `git clone https://yourusername@github.com/yourusername/paper.js.git`

3. This is important: Create a so-called *topic branch*: `git checkout -tb name-of-my-patch` where "name-of-my-patch" is a short but descriptive name of the patch you're about to create. Don't worry about the perfect name though -- you can change this name at any time later on.

4. Hack! Make your changes, additions, etc and commit them.

5. Send a pull request to the upstream repository's owner by visiting your repository's site at github (i.e. https://github.com/yourusername/paper.js) and press the "Pull Request" button. Here's a good guide on pull requests: <http://help.github.com/pull-requests/>

**Use one topic branch per feature** -- don't mix different kinds of patches in the same branch. Instead, merge them all together into your master branch (or develop everything in your master and then cherry-pick-and-merge into the different topic branches). Git provides for an extremely flexible workflow, which in many ways causes more confusion than it helps you when new to collaborative software development. The guides provided by GitHub at <http://help.github.com/> are a really good starting point and reference.
If you are fixing a ticket, a convenient way to name the branch is to use the URL slug from the bug tracker, like this: `git checkout -tb 53-feature-manually-select-language`.

#### Contributor License Agreement

Before we can accept any contributions to Paper.js, you need to sign this [CLA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement):
